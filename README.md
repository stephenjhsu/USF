# USF

Code and PDF containing the analysis of current cohort 5 and alumni from the University of San Francisco MSAN program. Using R, xml, regex, and other techniques, USF student degree trends and experience were scraped, cleaned, and visualized. Note that the USF webpage has since changed, meaning that the alumni profile will no longer work with the current code.
